# BlackDeath
BlackDeath is a stochastic simulation of disease spread. It simulates the change in a population affected by a disease characterized by three probabilities:
1. Infection probability
2. Death probability
3. Cure probability

Recently, a fourth probability was introduced to add a new dimension to the simulation: vaccination probability

The program displays the simulation time left while running. Also, after execution, it displays three image plots and one moving animation.

Currently, this program can be executed conveniently from Spyder but I will try to make a UI for it soon.
